# ghostpepper_bot
This is the code for the ghost pepper bot. Version control is done here on GitHub, and the bot is run on Replit.
There are a variety of commands that the bot can do such as roasting, giving users pick uplines, 8 ball responses, coinflips, and some fun easter eggs that are found when certain key words are sent.
