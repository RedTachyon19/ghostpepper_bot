# ghostpepper_bot
This is the code for the ghost pepper bot. Version control is done here on GitHub, however the bot is run on Replit.
The ghostpepper bot currently is only capable of roasting users when they type the command '/roast'
Some limitations currently that I need to address is connecting this bot to a google drive API so that roast are stored in on a google sheet.
I also need to address the fact that the code stops running every hour if inactive.
